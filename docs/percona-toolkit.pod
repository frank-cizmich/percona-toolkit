=head1 NAME

Percona Toolkit - Advanced command-line tools used by Percona for MySQL support and consulting

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Percona Toolkit is a collection of advanced command-line tools used by
Percona (L<http://www.percona.com/>) support staff to perform a variety of
MySQL and system tasks that are too difficult or complex to perform manually.

These tools are ideal alternatives to private or "one-off" scripts because
they are professionally developed, formally tested, and fully documented.
They are also fully self-contained, so installation is quick and easy and
no libraries are installed. 

Percona Toolkit is developed and supported by Percona Inc.  For more

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILES

Percona Toolkit tools can read options from configuration files.  The
configuration file syntax is simple and direct, and bears some resemblances
to the MySQL command-line client tools.  The configuration files all follow
the same conventions.

Internally, what actually happens is that the lines are read from the file and
then added as command-line options and arguments to the tool, so just
think of the configuration files as a way to write your command lines.

=head2 SYNTAX

The syntax of the configuration files is as follows:

=over

=item *

Whitespace followed by a hash (#) sign signifies that the rest of the line is a
comment.  This is deleted.

=item *

Whitespace is stripped from the beginning and end of all lines.

=item *

Empty lines are ignored.

=item *

Each line is permitted to be in either of the following formats:

  option
  option=value

Whitespace around the equals sign is deleted during processing.

=item *

Only long options are recognized.

=item *

A line containing only two hyphens signals the end of option parsing.  Any
further lines are interpreted as additional arguments (not options) to the
program.

=back

=head2 READ ORDER

The tools read several configuration files in order:

=over

=item 1.

The global Percona Toolkit configuration file,
F</etc/percona-toolkit/percona-toolkit.conf>.  All tools read this file,
so you should only add options to it that you want to apply to all tools.

=item 2.

The global tool-specific configuration file, F</etc/percona-toolkit/TOOL.conf>,
where C<TOOL> is a tool name like C<pt-query-digest>.  This file is named
after the specific tool you're using, so you can add options that apply
only to that tool.

=item 3.

The user's own Percona Toolkit configuration file,
F<$HOME/.percona-toolkit.conf>.  All tools read this file, so you should only
add options to it that you want to apply to all tools.

=item 4.

The user's tool-specific configuration file, F<$HOME/.TOOL.conf>,
where C<TOOL> is a tool name like C<pt-query-digest>.  This file is named
after the specific tool you're using, so you can add options that apply
only to that tool.

=back

=head2 SPECIFYING

There is a special C<--config> option, which lets you specify which
configuration files Percona Toolkit should read.  You specify a
comma-separated list of files.  However, its behavior is not like other
command-line options.  It must be given B<first> on the command line,
before any other options.  If you try to specify it anywhere else, it will
cause an error.  Also, you cannot specify C<--config=/path/to/file>;
you must specify the option and the path to the file separated by whitespace
I<without an equal sign> between them, like:

  --config /path/to/file

If you don't want any configuration files at all, specify C<--config ''> to
provide an empty list of files.

=head1 DSN (DATA SOURCE NAME) SPECIFICATIONS

Percona Toolkit tools use DSNs to specify how to create a DBD connection to
a MySQL server.  A DSN is a comma-separated string of C<key=value> parts, like:

  h=host1,P=3306,u=bob

The standard key parts are shown below, but some tools add additional key
parts.  See each tool's documentation for details.

Some tools do not use DSNs but still connect to MySQL using options like
C<--host>, C<--user>, and C<--password>.  Such tools uses these options to
create a DSN automatically, behind the scenes.

Other tools uses both DSNs and options like the ones above.  The options
provide defaults for all DSNs that do not specify the option's corresponding
key part.  For example, if DSN C<h=host1> and option C<--port=12345> are
specified, then the tool automatically adds C<P=12345> to DSN.

=head2 KEY PARTS

Many of the tools add more parts to DSNs for special purposes, and sometimes
override parts to make them do something slightly different.  However, all the
tools support at least the following:

=over

=item A

Specifies the default character set for the connection.

Enables character set settings in Perl and MySQL.  If the value is C<utf8>, sets
Perl's binmode on STDOUT to utf8, passes the C<mysql_enable_utf8> option to
DBD::mysql, and runs C<SET NAMES UTF8> after connecting to MySQL.  Any other
value sets binmode on STDOUT without the utf8 layer, and runs C<SET NAMES> after
connecting to MySQL.

Unfortunately, there is no way from within Perl itself to specify the client
library's character set.  C<SET NAMES> only affects the server; if the client
library's settings don't match, there could be problems.  You can use the
defaults file to specify the client library's character set, however.  See the
description of the F part below.

=item D

Specifies the connection's default database.

=item F

Specifies a defaults file the mysql client library (the C client library used by
DBD::mysql, I<not Percona Toolkit itself>) should read.  The tools all read the
[client] section within the defaults file.  If you omit this, the standard
defaults files will be read in the usual order.  "Standard" varies from system
to system, because the filenames to read are compiled into the client library.
On Debian systems, for example, it's usually /etc/mysql/my.cnf then ~/.my.cnf.
If you place the following into ~/.my.cnf, tools will Do The Right Thing:

  [client]
  user=your_user_name
  pass=secret

Omitting the F part is usually the right thing to do.  As long as you have
configured your ~/.my.cnf correctly, that will result in tools connecting
automatically without needing a username or password.

You can also specify a default character set in the defaults file.  Unlike the
L<"A"> part described above, this will actually instruct the client library
(DBD::mysql) to change the character set it uses internally, which cannot be
accomplished any other way as far as I know, except for C<utf8>.

=item h

Hostname or IP address for the connection.

=item p

Password to use when connecting.


=item P

Port number to use for the connection.  Note that the usual special-case
behaviors apply: if you specify C<localhost> as your hostname on Unix systems,
the connection actually uses a socket file, not a TCP/IP connection, and thus
ignores the port.

=item S

Socket file to use for the connection (on Unix systems).

=item u

User for login if not current user.

=back

=head2 BAREWORD

Many of the tools will let you specify a DSN as a single word, without any
C<key=value> syntax.  This is called a 'bareword'.  How this is handled is
tool-specific, but it is usually interpreted as the L<"h"> part.  The tool's
C<--help> output will tell you the behavior for that tool.

=head2 PROPAGATION

Many tools will let you propagate values from one DSN to the next, so you don't
have to specify all the parts for each DSN.  For example, if you want to specify
a username and password for each DSN, you can connect to three hosts as follows:

 h=host1,u=fred,p=wilma host2 host3

This is tool-specific.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

The environment variable C<PTDEBUG> enables verbose debugging output to STDERR.
To enable debugging and capture all output to a file, run the tool like:

   PTDEBUG=1 pt-table-checksum ... > FILE 2>&1

Be careful: debugging output is voluminous and can generate several megabytes
of output.

=head1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

Most tools require:

=over

=item * Perl v5.8 or newer

=item * Bash v3 or newer

=item * Core Perl modules like Time::HiRes

=back

Tools that connect to MySQL require:

=over

=item * Perl modules DBI and DBD::mysql

=item * MySQL 5.0 or newer

=back

Percona Toolkit is only tested on UNIX systems, primarily Debian and
Red Hat derivatives; other operating systems are not supported.

Tools that connect to MySQL may work with MySQL v4.1, but this is not
test or supported.
