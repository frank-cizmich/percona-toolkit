# Package: Runtime
# Runtime keeps track of time to control how long a tool's main loop runs.
# This package was created to handle mk-query-digest --run-time-mode event.
# In essence, we abstract time so that the tool doesn't know/care whether
# now() comes from a clock, a log timestamp, or wherever.  The creator of
# Runtime object determines how, or from where, time is gotten so that the
# caller of the object can simply ask, "What time is it?".
