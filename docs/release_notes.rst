Release Notes
*************

v1.0.1 released 2011-09-01
==========================

Percona Toolkit 1.0.1 has been released.  In July, Baron announced planned
changes to Maatkit and Aspersa development;[1]  Percona Toolkit is the
result.  In brief, Percona Toolkit is the combined fork of Maatkit and
Aspersa, so although the toolkit is new, the programs are not.  That means
Percona Toolkit 1.0.1 is mature, stable, and production-ready.  In fact,
it's even a little more stable because we fixed a few bugs in this release.

Percona Toolkit packages can be downloaded from
http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-toolkit/
or the Percona Software Repositories
(http://www.percona.com/docs/wiki/repositories:start).

Although Maatkit and Aspersa development use Google Code, Percona Toolkit
uses Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/percona-toolkit
