=head1 NAME

pt-sift - Browses files created by pt-collect.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Usage: pt-sift FILE|PREFIX|DIRECTORY

pt-sift browses the files created by L<pt-collect>.  If you specify a
FILE or PREFIX, it browses only files with that prefix.  If you specify a
DIRECTORY, then it browses all files within that directory.

=head1 RISKS

The following section is included to inform users about the potential risks,
whether known or unknown, of using this tool.  The two main categories of risks
are those created by the nature of the tool (e.g. read-only tools vs. read-write
tools) and those created by bugs.

pt-sift is a read-only tool.  It should be very low-risk.

At the time of this release, we know of no bugs that could cause serious harm
to users.

The authoritative source for updated information is always the online issue
tracking system.  Issues that affect this tool will be marked as such.  You can
see a list of such issues at the following URL:
L<http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-sift>.

See also L<"BUGS"> for more information on filing bugs and getting help.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

pt-sift downloads other tools that it might need, such as L<pt-diskstats>,
and then makes a list of the unique timestamp prefixes of all the files in
the directory, as written by the L<pt-collect> tool.  If the user specified
a timestamp on the command line, then it begins with that sample of data;
otherwise it begins by showing a list of the timestamps and prompting for
a selection.  Thereafter, it displays a summary of the selected sample, and
the user can navigate and inspect with keystrokes.  The keystroke commands
you can use are as follows:

=over

=item d

Sets the action to start the L<pt-diskstats> tool on the sample's disk
performance statistics.

=item i

Sets the action to view the first INNODB STATUS sample in less.

=item m

Displays the first 4 samples of SHOW STATUS counters side by side with the
L<pt-mext> tool.

=item n

Summarizes the first sample of netstat data in two ways: by originating host,
and by connection state.

=item j

Select the next timestamp as the active sample.

=item k

Select the previous timestamp as the active sample.

=item q

Quit the program.

=item 1

Sets the action for each sample to the default, which is to view a summary
of the sample.

=item 0

Sets the action to just list the files in the sample.

=item *

Sets the action to view all of the samples's files in the less program.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

This tool does not have any command-line options.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT

This tool does not use any environment variables.

=head1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

This tool requires Bash v3 and the following programs: pt-diskstats, pt-pmp,
pt-mext, and pt-align.  If these programs are not in your PATH,
they will be fetched from the Internet if curl is available.

=head1 BUGS

For a list of known bugs, see L<http://www.percona.com/bugs/pt-sift>.

Please report bugs at L<https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-toolkit>.
Include the following information in your bug report:

=over

=item * Complete command-line used to run the tool

=item * Tool L<"--version">

=item * MySQL version of all servers involved

=item * Output from the tool including STDERR

=item * Input files (log/dump/config files, etc.)

=back

If possible, include debugging output by running the tool with C<PTDEBUG>;
see L<"ENVIRONMENT">.

=head1 ABOUT PERCONA TOOLKIT

This tool is part of Percona Toolkit, a collection of advanced command-line
tools developed by Percona for MySQL support and consulting.  Percona Toolkit
was forked from two projects in June, 2011: Maatkit and Aspersa.  Those
projects were created by Baron Schwartz and developed primarily by him and
Daniel Nichter, both of whom are employed by Percona.  Visit
