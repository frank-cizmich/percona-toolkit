v2.1.8 released 2012-12-21
==========================

Percona Toolkit 2.1.8 has been released.  This release includes 28 bug fixes, beta support for MySQL 5.6, and extensive support for Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC); Users intending on running the tools on Percona XtraDB Cluster or MySQL 5.6 should strongly consider upgrading. The following tools have been verified to work on PXC versions 5.5.28 and newer:

* pt-table-chcecksum

* pt-online-schema-change

* pt-archive

* pt-mysql-summary

* pt-heartbeat

* pt-variable-advisor

* pt-config-diff

* pt-deadlock-logger

Although there are some limitations: See the Percona XtraDB Cluster section in each tool's documentation for further details. All other tools, with the exception of pt-slave-find, pt-slave-delay and pt-slave-restart, should also work correctly, but in some cases they have not been modified to take advantage of PXC features, so they may behave differently in future releases.

The bug fixes are widely assorted.  The following highlights some of the more interesting and "hot" bugs:

* Fixed bug 1082599: pt-query-digest fails to parse timestamp with no query

Logs which include timestamps with no query -- which can occasionally happen, for example, if using the slow_query_log_timestamp_always in Percona Server -- were misparsed, resulting in an erroneous report.

* Fixed bug 1078838: pt-query-digest doesn't parse general log with "Connect user as user"

The "as" was misparsed and the following word would end up reported as the database; pt-query-digest now handles this correctly.

* Fixed bug 1015590: pt-mysql-summary not Percona Server 5.5-ready

Some renamed variables had caused the Percona Server section to work unreliably.

* Fixed bug 917770: Use of uninitialized value in substitution (s///) at pt-config-diff line 1996

This was the hottest bug affecting a tool in the tracker.

* Fixed bug 886059: pt-heartbeat handles timezones inconsistently

Another 'hot' bug: Previously pt-heartbeat occasionally respected MySQL timezones, but sometimes it ignored them and used the system time instead. This generally wouldn't be troublesome, but resulted in erroneous reports for servers with slaves running in different timezones.

2.1.8 continues the trend of solid bug fix releases, and all 2.1 users are encouraged to upgrade.

Percona Toolkit packages can be downloaded from http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-toolkit/ or the Percona Software Repositories (http://www.percona.com/software/repositories/).

v2.1.7 released 2012-11-19
==========================

Percona Toolkit 2.1.7 has been released which is a hotfix for two bugs when using pt-table-checksum with Percona XtraDB Cluster:

* Bug 1080384: pt-table-checksum 2.1.6 crashes using PTDEBUG
* Bug 1080385: pt-table-checksum 2.1.6 --check-binlog-format doesn't ignore PXC nodes

If you're using pt-table-checksum with a Percona XtraDB Cluster, you should upgrade.  Otherwise, users can wait until the next full release.

Percona Toolkit packages can be downloaded from http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-toolkit/ or the Percona Software Repositories (http://www.percona.com/software/repositories/).

Changelog
---------

* Fixed bug 1080384: pt-table-checksum 2.1.6 crashes using PTDEBUG
* Fixed bug 1080385: pt-table-checksum 2.1.6 --check-binlog-format doesn't ignore PXC nodes

v2.1.6 released 2012-11-13
==========================

Percona Toolkit 2.1.6 has been released.  This release includes 33 bug fixes and three new features: pt-online-schema-change now handles renaming columns without losing data, removing one of the tool's limitations.  pt-online-schema-change also got two new options: --default-engine and --statistics.  Finally, pt-stalk now has a plugin hook interface, available through the --plugin option.  The bug fixes are widely assorted.  The following highlights some of the more interesting and "hot" bugs:

* Bug 978133: pt-query-digest review table privilege checks don't work

The same checks were removed from pt-table-checksum on 2.1.3 and pt-table-sync on 2.1.4, so this just follows suit.

* Bug 938068: pt-table-checksum doesn't warn if binlog_format=row or mixed on slaves

A particularly important fix, as it may stop pt-table-checksum from breaking replication in these setups.

* Bug 1043438: pt-table-checksum doesn't honor --run-time while checking replication lag

If you run multiple instances of pt-table-checksum on a badly lagged server, actually respecting --run-time stops the instances from divebombing the server when the replica catches up.

* Bug 1062324: pt-online-schema-change DELETE trigger fails when altering primary key

Fixed by choosing a key on the new table for the DELETE trigger.

* Bug 1062563: pt-table-checksum 2.1.4 doesn't detect diffs on Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes

A follow up to the same fix in the previous release, this adds to warnings for cases in which pt-table-checksum may work incorrectly and require some user intervention: One for the case of master -> cluster, and one for cluster1 -> cluster2.

* Bug 821715: LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE broken in some platforms

This bug has hounded the toolkit for quite some time. In some platforms, trying to use LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE would fail as if the user didn't have enough privileges to perform the operation.  This was a misdiagnoses from MySQL; The actual problem was that the libmysqlclient.so provided by some vendors was compiled in a way that disallowed users from using the statement without some extra work.  This fix adds an 'L' option to the DSNs the toolkit uses, tells the the tools to explicitly enables LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE.  This affected two pt-archiver and pt-upgrade, so if you are on an effected OS and need to use those, you can simply tag an L=1 to your DSN and everything should start working.

* Bug 866075: pt-show-grant doesn't support column-level grants

This was actually the 'hottest' bug in the tracker.

This is another solid bug fix release, and all 2.1 users are encouraged to upgrade.

Percona Toolkit packages can be downloaded from http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-toolkit/ or the Percona Software Repositories (http://www.percona.com/software/repositories/).

v2.1.5 released 2012-10-08
==========================

Percona Toolkit 2.1.5 has been released.  This release is less than two weeks after the release of 2.1.4 because we wanted to address these bugs quickly:

* Bug 1062563: pt-table-checksum 2.1.4 doesn't detect diffs on Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes

* Bug 1063912: pt-table-checksum 2.1.4 miscategorizes Percona XtraDB Cluster-based slaves as cluster nodes

* Bug 1064016: pt-table-sync 2.1.4 --version-check may not work with HTTPS/SSL

The first two bugs fix how pt-table-checksum works with Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC).  Although the 2.1.4 release did introduce support for PXC, these bugs prevented pt-table-checksum from working correctly with a cluster.

The third bug is also related to a feature new in 2.1.4: --version-check.  The feature uses HTTPS/SSL by default, but some modules in pt-table-sync weren't update which could prevent it from working on older systems.  Related, the version check web page mentioned in tools' documentation was also created.

If you're using pt-table-checksum with a Percona XtraDB Cluster, you should definitely upgrade.  Otherwise, users can wait until 2.1.6 for another full release.

Percona Toolkit packages can be downloaded from http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-toolkit/ or the Percona Software Repositories (http://www.percona.com/software/repositories/).

Changelog
---------

* Fixed bug 1062563: pt-table-checksum 2.1.4 doesn't detect diffs on Percona XtraDB Cluster nodes
* Fixed bug 1063912: pt-table-checksum 2.1.4 miscategorizes Percona XtraDB Cluster-based slaves as cluster nodes
* Fixed bug 1064016: pt-table-sync 2.1.4 --version-check may not work with HTTPS/SSL
* Fixed bug 1060423: Missing version-check page

v2.1.4 released 2012-09-20
==========================

Percona Toolkit 2.1.4 has been released.  This release includes 26 bug fixes and three new features: Making pt-table-checksum work with Percona XtraDB Cluster, adding a --run-time option to pt-table-checksum, and implementing the "Version Check" feature, enabled through the --version-check switch.  For further information on --version-check, see http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2012/09/10/introducing-the-version-check-feature-in-percona-toolkit/.  The bug fixes are widely assorted.  The following highlights some of the more interesting and "hot" bugs:

* Fixed bug 1017626: pt-table-checksum doesn't work with Percona XtraDB Cluster

Note that this requires Percona XtraDB Cluster 5.5.27-23.6 or newer, as the fix depends on this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/codership-mysql/+bug/1023911 being resolved.

* Fixed bug 1034170: pt-table-checksum --defaults-file isn't used for slaves

Previously, users had no recourse but using --recursion-method in conjunction with a dsn table to sidestep this bug, so this fix is a huge usability gain.  This was caused by the toolkit not copying the -F portion of the main dsn.

* Fixed bug 1039184: pt-upgrade error "I need a right_sth argument"

Which were stopping pt-upgrade from working on a MySQL 4.1 host.

* Fixed bug 1036747: pt-table-sync priv checks need to be removed

The same checks were removed in the previous release from pt-table-checksum, so this continues the trend.

* Fixed bug 1038995: pt-stalk --notify-by-email fails

This was a bug in our shell option parsing library, and would potentially affect any option starting with 'no'.

Like 2.1.3, this is another solid bug fix release, and 2.1 users are encouraged to upgrade.

Percona Toolkit packages can be downloaded from http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-toolkit/ or the Percona Software Repositories (http://www.percona.com/software/repositories/).

v2.1.3 released 2012-08-03
==========================

Percona Toolkit 2.1.3 has been released.  This release includes 31 bug fixes and one new feature: pt-kill --log-dsn to log information about killed queries to a table.  The bug fixes are widely assorted.  The following highlights some of the more interesting and "hot" bugs:

* Fixed bug 916168: pt-table-checksum privilege check fails on MySQL 5.5

pt-table-checksum used to check the user's privileges, but the method was not always reliable, and due to http://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=61846 it became quite unreliable on MySQL 5.5.  So the privs check was removed altogether, meaning that the tool may fail later if the user's privileges are insufficient.

* Fixed bug 950294: pt-table-checksum should always create schema and tables with IF NOT EXISTS

In certain cases where the master and replicas have different schemas and/or tables, pt-table-checksum could break replication because the checksums table did not exist on a replica.

* Fixed bug 821703: pt-query-digest --processlist may crash
* Fixed bug 883098: pt-query-digest crashes if processlist has extra columns

Certain distributions of MySQL add extra columns to SHOW PROCESSLIST which caused pt-query-digest --processlist to crash at times.

* Fixed bug 941469: pt-kill doesn't reconnect if its connection is lost

pt-kill is meant to be a long-running daemon, so naturally it's important that it stays connected to MySQL.

* Fixed bug 1004567: pt-heartbeat --update --replace causes duplicate key error

The combination of these pt-heartbeat options could cause replication to break due to a duplicate key error.

* Fixed bug 1022628: pt-online-schema-change error: Use of uninitialized value in numeric lt (<) at line 6519

This bug was related to how --quiet was handled, and it could happen even if --quiet wasn't given on the command line.

All in all, this is solid bug fix release, and 2.1 users are encouraged to upgrade.

Percona Toolkit packages can be downloaded from http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-toolkit/ or the Percona Software Repositories (http://www.percona.com/software/repositories/).

v2.1.2 released 2012-06-12
==========================

Percona Toolkit 2.1.2 has been released.  This is a very important release because it fixes a critical bug in pt-table-sync (bug 1003014) which caused various failures.  All users of Percona Toolkit 2.1 should upgrade to this release.  There were 47 other bug fixes, several new options, and other changes.  The following is a high-level summary of the most important changes.

In addition to the critical bug fix mentioned above, another important pt-table-sync bug was fixed, bug 1002365: --ignore-* options did not work with --replicate.  The --lock-and-rename feature of the tool was also disabled unless running MySQL 5.5 or newer because it did not work reliably in earlier versions of MySQL.

Several important pt-table-checksum bugs were fixed.  First, a bug caused the tool to ignore the primary key.  Second, the tool did not wait for the checksum table to replicate, so it could select from a nonexistent table on a replica and crash.  Third, it did not check if all checksum queries were safe and chunk index with more than 3 columns could cause MySQL to scan many more rows than expected.

pt-online-schema-change received many improvements and fixes: it did not retry deadlocks, but now it does; --no-swap-tables caused an error; it did not handle column renames; it did not allow disabling foreign key checks; --dry-run always failed on tables with foreign keys; it used different keys for chunking and triggers; etc.  In short: pt-online-schema-change 2.1.2 is superior to 2.1.1.

Two pt-archiver bugs were fixed: bug 979092, --sleep conflicts with bulk operations; and bug 903379, --file doesn't create a file.

--recursion-method=none was implemented in pt-heartbeat, pt-online-schema-change, pt-slave-find, pt-slave-restart, pt-table-checksum, and pt-table-sync.  This allows these tools to avoid executing SHOW SLAVE STATUS which requires a privilege not available to Amazon RDS users.

Other bugs were fixed in pt-stalk, pt-variable-advisor, pt-duplicate-key-checker, pt-diskstats, pt-query-digest, pt-sift, pt-kill, pt-summary, and pt-deadlock-logger.

Percona Toolkit 2.1.2 should be backwards-compatible with 2.1.1, so users are strongly encouraged to upgrade.

Percona Toolkit packages can be downloaded from http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-toolkit/ or the Percona Software Repositories (http://www.percona.com/software/repositories/).

v2.1.1 released 2012-04-03
==========================

Percona Toolkit 2.1.1 has been released.  This is the first release in the
new 2.1 series which supersedes the 2.0 series.  We will continue to fix bugs
in 2.0, but 2.1 is now the focus of development.

2.1 introduces a lot of new code for:

* pt-online-schema-change (completely redesigned)
* pt-mysql-summary (completely redesigned)
* pt-summary (completely redesigned)
* pt-fingerprint (new tool)
* pt-table-usage (new tool)

There were also several bug fixes.

The redesigned tools are meant to replace their 2.0 counterparts because
the 2.1 versions have the same or more functionality and they are simpler
and more reliable.  pt-online-schema-change was particularly enhanced to
be as safe as possible given that the tool is inherently risky.

Percona Toolkit packages can be downloaded from
http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-toolkit/ or the Percona Software
Repositories (http://www.percona.com/software/repositories/).

Changelog

v2.0.4 released 2012-03-07
==========================

Percona Toolkit 2.0.4 has been released.  23 bugs were fixed in this release,
and three new features were implemented.  First, --filter was added to pt-kill
which allows for arbitrary --group-by.  Second, pt-online-schema-change now
requires that its new --execute option be given, else the tool will just check
the tables and exit.  This is a safeguard to encourage users to read the
documentation, particularly when replication is involved.  Third, pt-stalk
also received a new option: --[no]stalk.  To collect immediately without
stalking, specify --no-stalk and the tool will collect once and exit.

This release is completely backwards compatible with previous 2.0 releases.
Given the number of bug fixes, it's worth upgrading to 2.0.4.

Changelog
---------

* Added --filter to pt-kill to allow arbitrary --group-by
* Added --[no]stalk to pt-stalk (bug 932331)

v2.0.3 released 2012-02-03
==========================

Percona Toolkit 2.0.3 has been released.  The development team was very
busy last month making this release significant: two completely
redesigned and improved tools, pt-diskstats and pt-stalk, and 20 bug fixes.

Both pt-diskstats and pt-stalk were redesigned and rewritten from the ground
up.  This allowed us to greatly improve these tools' functionality and
increase testing for them.  The accuracy and output of pt-diskstats was
enhanced, and the tool was rewritten in Perl.  pt-collect was removed and
its functionality was put into a new, enhanced pt-stalk.  pt-stalk is now
designed to be a stable, long-running daemon on a variety of common platforms.
It is worth re-reading the documentation for each of these tools.

The 20 bug fixes cover a wide range of problems.  The most important are
fixes to pt-table-checksum, pt-iostats, and pt-kill.  Apart from pt-diskstats,
pt-stalk, and pt-collect (which was removed), no other tools were changed
in backwards-incompatible ways, so it is worth reviewing the full changelog
for this release and upgrading if you use any tools which had bug fixes.

Thank you to the many people who reported bugs and submitted patches.

v2.0.1 released 2011-12-30
==========================

The Percona Toolkit development team is proud to announce a new major version:
2.0.  Beginning with Percona Toolkit 2.0, we are overhauling, redesigning, and
improving the major tools.  2.0 tools are therefore not backwards compatible
with 1.0 tools, which we still support but will not continue to develop.

New in Percona Toolkit 2.0.1 is a completely redesigned pt-table-checksum.
The original pt-table-checksum 1.0 was rather complex, but it worked well
for many years.  By contrast, the new pt-table-checksum 2.0 is much simpler but
also much more efficient and reliable.  We spent months rethinking, redesigning,
and testing every aspect of the tool.  The three most significant changes:
pt-table-checksum 2.0 does only --replicate, it has only one chunking algorithm,
and its memory usage is stable even with hundreds of thousands of tables and
trillions of rows.  The tool is now dedicated to verifying MySQL replication
integrity, nothing else, which it does extremely well.

In Percona Toolkit 2.0.1 we also fixed various small bugs and forked ioprofile
and align (as pt-ioprofile and pt-align) from Aspersa.

If you still need functionalities in the original pt-table-checksum,
the latest Percona Toolkit 1.0 release remains available for download.
Otherwise, all new development in Percona Toolkit will happen in 2.0.

v1.0.1 released 2011-09-01
==========================

Percona Toolkit 1.0.1 has been released.  In July, Baron announced planned
changes to Maatkit and Aspersa development;[1]  Percona Toolkit is the
result.  In brief, Percona Toolkit is the combined fork of Maatkit and
Aspersa, so although the toolkit is new, the programs are not.  That means
Percona Toolkit 1.0.1 is mature, stable, and production-ready.  In fact,
it's even a little more stable because we fixed a few bugs in this release.

Percona Toolkit packages can be downloaded from
http://www.percona.com/downloads/percona-toolkit/
or the Percona Software Repositories
(http://www.percona.com/docs/wiki/repositories:start).

Although Maatkit and Aspersa development use Google Code, Percona Toolkit
uses Launchpad: https://launchpad.net/percona-toolkit

Changelog
---------

* Fixed bug 819421: MasterSlave::is_replication_thread() doesn't match all
* Fixed bug 821673: pt-table-checksum doesn't include --where in min max queries
* Fixed bug 821688: pt-table-checksum SELECT MIN MAX for char chunking is wrong
* Fixed bug 838211: pt-collect: line 24: [: : integer expression expected
* Fixed bug 838248: pt-collect creates a "5.1" file

v0.9.5 released 2011-08-04
==========================

Percona Toolkit 0.9.5 represents the completed transition from Maatkit and Aspersa.  There are no bug fixes or new features, but some features have been removed (like --save-results from pt-query-digest).  This release is the starting point for the 1.0 series where new development will happen, and no more changes will be made to the 0.9 series.

Changelog
---------

* Forked, combined, and rebranded Maatkit and Aspersa as Percona Toolkit.
